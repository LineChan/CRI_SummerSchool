## What is the CRI ?

The Center for Reseach and Interdisciplinarity (CRI : *Centre de Recherches Interdisciplinaire* in Paris) is dedicated to **training through research**, especially in Biology, and alternative ways to learn. Their method is based on  collective intelligence and learning by doing.

More info here : [*CRI Website*](https://cri-paris.org/)

## The Labs Summer School
The CRI Summer School is a **7 week challenge-based program**, hosted by the CRI GameLab and MakerLab.
In it, 50 international students, from a variety of fields, join forces to learn through masterclasses, workshops, hackathons, and by **developing projects tackling the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals** – specifically Health & Environment.

*How?*

By creating games and making devices that benefit from **digital fabrication** *(3D printing, rapid prototyping, etc.)*. Experts in serious game making, medicine, environmental science, digital fabrication, frugal innovation – and more! – mentor groups of students as they hack their way to a better world.

All the projects made by students  were exposed at the **Cite des Sciences et de l'Industrie** in Paris on **August 4th 2017**.

### Context
### Problematic
The **spine** is one of the most used articulation : more than **1500 times a day** ! People from 15 to 45 years old are the most concerned and one in two kids already experienced it. Thus **lower back pain** is the second reason why people consult their general practitioner. It results in a **2.3 million euro bill** to the Medical Benefit Fund. (1)

Back pains mainly come from our **sedentary lifestyle** and its consequences, meaning our partial inactivity. Most of the time no medical care nor further exams are necessary. The best way to prevent back pains or get rid of is to stretch and strengthen it. Therefore **personal habits** have an important role to play in these situations.

As a solution awareness campaigns were launched. Medical books were distributed (*“Osons parler”*) and doctors started to use interpretative guides with their patients. However their **impact is limited** :
* most of the time people don’t feel concerned until they experience back pain
* knowing the right positions isn’t adopting them because training is needed to correct body postures. A study showed that 70% of the patients don’t practice at home exercises given by their practitioner. (2)

We would like our game to tackle down these two problems at the same time. 

### What are the current available solutions and their limits ?
We look up at companies on the market and found [Motek Force Link](https://www.motekforcelink.com/products/), a rehabilitation center in Amsterdam specialized in **balance disorder**. With their partnerships dedicated to recovering technologies and virtual reality they have a huge infrastructure with high technologies. [MIRA Rehab](https://www.motekforcelink.com/products/) in London also releases therapeutic games on movement recognitions thanks to a camera. 

Because we wanted to create something affordable,  we hunt for startups working on back pains with IoT devices. [Thuasne](http://monmaldedos.fr/) and [Koondal](http://koondal.fr/) offer their users to track their activities during the day and thanks to a chatbot or an app their would receive yoga postures according to the data collected and the exercises the users want to practice. We contacted Koondal and met them. They lent us some materials so we can **quickly start to work on our project**.

### Target
Because the major part of the population is concerned we think that a massive target can be reached. Indeed more than **70% of the people play video games**, gender parity is mostly respected and more than one in four players is on smartphone. Most of the interviewed people (more than 70%) play for fun and only 10% of them to learn something. (1) This reinforced the idea that we have to make **the educational part as discreet as possible** so we can target a larger public.

Video game penetration and age repartition (%)
How to read : “between October 2012 and March 2013, 86.1% of the French population between 6 and 9 years old played a video game and 26.2% of players are between 35 and 49 years old”


Because of the technology we use (*mobile application, virtual reality headset*), we reduced our target to people from 15 to 50 years old, meaning we aim at groups with more than 60% of players. We also decided to remove younger players because a smartphone is required to play the game. Moreover the gameplay is based on enigmaa resolutions and puzzles  so it might be over complicated for kids or young teens.
