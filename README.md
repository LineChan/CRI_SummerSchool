## What is the Labs Summer School ?

The CRI Summer School is a 7 week challenge-based programme, hosted by the CRI GameLab and MakerLab. In it, 50 international students, from a variety of fields, will join forces to learn through masterclasses, workshops, hackathons, and by developing projects tackling the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals – specifically Health & Environment.
How? By creating games and making devices that benefit from digital fabrication (3D printing, rapid prototyping, etc.). Experts in serious game making, medicine, environmental science, digital fabrication, frugal innovation – and more! – will mentor groups of students as they hack their way to a better world

### Program

Week 1 : Workshops on serious games
Week 2 : Workshops in the MakerLab (digital fabrication tools and open source hardware)
Week 3 : Kickstarting project with mentors
Week 4 - 5 : Producing a functionnal prototype
Week 6 : Exposition on August 4th 2017 at the Cité des Sciences et de l’Industrie in Paris, so  the public gets to experiment projects.
