## What is the Labs Summer School ?

The CRI Summer School is a 7 week challenge-based programme, hosted by the CRI GameLab and MakerLab. In it, 50 international students, from a variety of fields, will join forces to learn through masterclasses, workshops, hackathons, and by developing projects tackling the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals – specifically Health & Environment.
How? By creating games and making devices that benefit from digital fabrication (3D printing, rapid prototyping, etc.). Experts in serious game making, medicine, environmental science, digital fabrication, frugal innovation – and more! – will mentor groups of students as they hack their way to a better world
