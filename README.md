## The Labs Summer School

The CRI Summer School is a **7 week challenge-based program**, hosted by the CRI GameLab and MakerLab.
In it, 50 international students, from a variety of fields, join forces to learn through masterclasses, workshops, hackathons, and by **developing projects tackling the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals** – specifically Health & Environment.

*How?*

By creating games and making devices that benefit from **digital fabrication** *(3D printing, rapid prototyping, etc.)*. Experts in serious game making, medicine, environmental science, digital fabrication, frugal innovation – and more! – mentor groups of students as they hack their way to a better world.

All the projects made by students  were exposed at the **Cite des Sciences et de l'Industrie** in Paris on **August 4th 2017**.
