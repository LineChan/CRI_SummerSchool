## What is the CRI ?

The Center for Reseach and Interdisciplinarity (CRI : *Centre de Recherches Interdisciplinaire* in Paris) is dedicated to **training through research**, especially in Biology, and alternative ways to learn. Their method is based on  collective intelligence and learning by doing.

## The Labs Summer School

The CRI Summer School is a **7 week challenge-based program**, hosted by the CRI GameLab and MakerLab.
In it, 50 international students, from a variety of fields, join forces to learn through masterclasses, workshops, hackathons, and by **developing projects tackling the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals** – specifically Health & Environment.

*How?*

By creating games and making devices that benefit from **digital fabrication** *(3D printing, rapid prototyping, etc.)*. Experts in serious game making, medicine, environmental science, digital fabrication, frugal innovation – and more! – mentor groups of students as they hack their way to a better world.

All the projects made by students  were exposed at the **Cite des Sciences et de l'Industrie** in Paris on **August 4th 2017**.

### [Context](#context)

The **spine** is one of the most used articulation : more than **1500 times a day** ! People from 15 to 45 years old are the most concerned and one in two kids already experienced it. Thus **lower back pain** is the second reason why people consult their general practitioner. It results in a **2.3 million euro bill** to the Medical Benefit Fund. (1)

Back pains mainly come from our **sedentary lifestyle** and its consequences, meaning our partial inactivity. Most of the time no medical care nor further exams are necessary. The best way to prevent back pains or get rid of is to stretch and strengthen it. Therefore **personal habits** have an important role to play in these situations.

As a solution awareness campaigns were launched. Medical books were distributed (*“Osons parler”*) and doctors started to use interpretative guides with their patients. However their **impact is limited** :
- most of the time people don’t feel concerned until they experience back pain
- knowing the right positions isn’t adopting them because training is needed to correct body postures. A study showed that 70% of the patients don’t practice at home exercises given by their practitioner. (2)

We would like our game to tackle down these two problems at the same time.
